# Curvature Analysis on Gene Co-Expression Networks

This Python script performs a complete topological analysis pipeline on gene co-expression networks, integrating biological and geometric properties through **Ollivier‚ÄìRicci curvature**.  
It builds a weighted graph from correlation data (e.g., GTEx/TCGA), computes curvature values using the `GraphRicciCurvature` library, and generates node-level features for downstream machine learning or **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** models.

## üß© What the Script Does

### **Input**
Reads two tab-separated (`.txt` or `.tsv`) files:

- **Edge file:** contains pairwise gene correlations  
  Columns required:  
  `source`, `target`, `category`, `correlation`, `pvalue`, `padj`
  
- **Node file:** contains metadata for each gene  
  Columns required:  
  `Name`, `symbol`, `info1`, `info2`, `info3`, `location`, `category`, `cluster`

Example input paths (can be changed in the script header):
```python
EDGE_FILE = "/Users/mariannamilano/Desktop/.txt"
NODE_FILE = "/Users/mariannamilano/Desktop/.txt"
OUT_DIR   = "/Users/mariannamilano/Desktop/output"


Network Construction

Maps Ensembl gene identifiers (e.g., ENSG000001234.5) to gene symbols.

Filters edges according to:

Minimum absolute correlation (MIN_ABS_CORR)

Maximum adjusted p-value (MAX_PADJ)

Builds a weighted graph with edge weight:

(

)
weight=‚à£correlation‚à£√ó(1‚àílog

	‚Äã

(padj))
Curvature Computation

Uses the Ollivier‚ÄìRicci curvature via the GraphRicciCurvature
 Python package.

Edge weights are considered during curvature computation (alpha = 0.5).

Outputs a file containing each edge with its corresponding curvature value.

Feature Extraction

Generates a node-level feature file including:

Metadata: symbol, category, cluster

Expression statistics: mean, standard deviation, min, max (parsed from node info columns)

Network metrics: degree, strength, mean absolute correlation

Curvature-based feature: mean curvature of incident edges per node

Statistical Summary

After curvature computation, the script reports:

Number of nodes and edges

Mean, variance, minimum, and maximum of curvature values

These statistics are saved in a summary file for further analysis.

üìÇ Output Files

All results are saved to the folder specified by OUT_DIR.
Example: /Users/mariannamilano/Desktop/results_sub42/

File	Description
curvature_edges.txt	Edge list with computed Ollivier‚ÄìRicci curvature values
curvature_stats.txt	Summary statistics of curvature distribution
node_labels_features.txt	Node-level features including biological and topological metrics

Example output line from curvature_edges.txt:

AP2S1, QSER1, 0.0732

‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

You can install all dependencies using:

pip install pandas numpy networkx GraphRicciCurvature

Required Python version:

Python ‚â• 3.8

Main dependencies:

pandas ‚Äî for tabular data management
