# ARGO: Ricci-Curvature-Guided Graph Neural Network Framework

**ARGO** (Algorithm for Ricci-curvature-Guided Optimization) is a Python framework for **community detection and topological learning** on biological networks.  
It combines **network geometry (Ricci curvature)** with **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to produce biologically meaningful embeddings and identify functional modules in gene co-expression or interaction networks.

Developed at the **University ‚ÄúMagna Graecia‚Äù of Catanzaro**, ARGO is part of a research pipeline integrating curvature, graph topology, and neural learning methods for biomedical data.

## üß© What the Script Does

### **Input**
Reads two files, previously generated from curvature analysis (e.g., using `curvaturanew.py`):

| File | Description | Required Columns |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| `curvature_edges.txt` | Edge list with Ricci curvature values | `source`, `target`, `ricci_curvature` |
| `node_labels_features.txt` | Node-level metadata and features | `symbol`, `degree`, `strength`, ... |

Default paths can be modified at the top of the script:
```python
BASE = "/Users/mariannamilano/Desktop/"
EDGE_FILE_CURV = os.path.join(BASE, "curvature_edges.txt")
NODE_FEAT_FILE = os.path.join(BASE, "node_labels_features.txt")
OUT_DIR = os.path.join(BASE, "results")


Processing Steps
1. Network Construction

Builds a weighted undirected graph from curvature-weighted edges.

Normalizes curvature values to positive weights.

Computes node-level statistics (degree and strength).

2. Graph Neural Network (GCN Autoencoder)

Initializes a 2-layer GCNEncoder (Graph Convolutional Network).

Learns low-dimensional embeddings by reconstructing network edges.

Uses a link prediction loss (binary cross-entropy with random negative sampling).

3. Training Phase

Optimizes the GCN with Adam optimizer (default 200 epochs, lr=1e-3).

Logs and plots the training loss (training_loss.csv and training_loss.png).

4. Evaluation

Performs link reconstruction to compute:

AUC (Area Under ROC Curve)

AUPR (Area Under Precision-Recall Curve)

Generates corresponding ROC and PR plots.

5. Community Detection

Applies K-Means clustering on the learned embeddings.

Automatically selects the best number of clusters (K) maximizing the Silhouette Score.

Outputs community composition and sizes.

6. Visualization

Performs PCA on the embedding space (2D visualization).

Colors nodes by community assignment (embedding_pca.png).

üìÇ Output Files

All results are saved in the specified output folder (default: /Users/mariannamilano/Desktop/results/).

File	Description

All results will be generated in the results/ directory.
The script will display AUC, AUPR, and cluster metrics in the terminal.


# Curvature Analysis on Gene Co-Expression Networks

This Python script performs a complete topological analysis pipeline on gene co-expression networks, integrating biological and geometric properties through **Ollivier‚ÄìRicci curvature**.  
It builds a weighted graph from correlation data (e.g., GTEx/TCGA), computes curvature values using the `GraphRicciCurvature` library, and generates node-level features for downstream machine learning or **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** models.

---

## üß© What the Script Does

### **Input**
Reads two tab-separated (`.txt` or `.tsv`) files:

- **Edge file:** contains pairwise gene correlations  
  Columns required:  
  `source`, `target`, `category`, `correlation`, `pvalue`, `padj`
  
- **Node file:** contains metadata for each gene  
  Columns required:  
  `Name`, `symbol`, `info1`, `info2`, `info3`, `location`, `category`, `cluster`

Example input paths (can be changed in the script header):
```python
EDGE_FILE = "/Users/mariannamilano/Desktop/.txt"
NODE_FILE = "/Users/mariannamilano/Desktop/.txt"
OUT_DIR   = "/Users/mariannamilano/Desktop/output"


Network Construction

Maps Ensembl gene identifiers (e.g., ENSG000001234.5) to gene symbols.

Filters edges according to:

Minimum absolute correlation (MIN_ABS_CORR)

Maximum adjusted p-value (MAX_PADJ)

Builds a weighted graph with edge weight:

weight
=
‚à£
correlation
‚à£
√ó
(

‚àí
log
‚Å°
10
(
padj
)
)
weight=‚à£correlation‚à£√ó(1‚àílog
10
	‚Äã

(padj))
Curvature Computation

Uses the Ollivier‚ÄìRicci curvature via the GraphRicciCurvature
 Python package.

Edge weights are considered during curvature computation (alpha = 0.5).

Outputs a file containing each edge with its corresponding curvature value.

Feature Extraction

Generates a node-level feature file including:

Metadata: symbol, category, cluster

Expression statistics: mean, standard deviation, min, max (parsed from node info columns)

Network metrics: degree, strength, mean absolute correlation

Curvature-based feature: mean curvature of incident edges per node

Statistical Summary

After curvature computation, the script reports:

Number of nodes and edges

Mean, variance, minimum, and maximum of curvature values

These statistics are saved in a summary file for further analysis.

üìÇ Output Files

All results are saved to the folder specified by OUT_DIR.
Example: /Users/mariannamilano/Desktop/results_sub42/

File	Description
curvature_edges.txt	Edge list with computed Ollivier‚ÄìRicci curvature values
curvature_stats.txt	Summary statistics of curvature distribution
node_labels_features.txt	Node-level features including biological and topological metrics
